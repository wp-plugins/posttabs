postTabs allows you to easily split your post/page content into Tabs that will be shown to your visitors

== Description ==

postTabs allows you to easily split your post/page content into Tabs that will be shown to your visitors.

The colors of the tab can be easily changed to match you theme

Tested on Firefox, IE6, iE7, Opera, Safari and Konqueror.

Please note that although it was tested in all major browsers, it still can have some conflict with a specific theme on a specific browser, and then you will need to adjust you css by hand.


== Installation ==

. Download the package
. Extract it to the "plugins" folder of your wordpress
. In the Admin Panes go to "Plugins" and activate it

== Usage ==

Go to Settings > PostTabs (or Options > postTabs) to adjust the colors of your tabs.

Edit your post and page and add the code below wherever you want to insert the tab:

[tab:Tab Title]

All the content bellow this code will be inserted inside this tab, untill another tab is declared with:

[tab:Another Tab]

And so on.. untill the end of the page or optionally you can add the code bellow to end the last tab and add more text outside the tabs:

[tab:END]

You can also have text before the first tab. Just type it as normal text...

== Screenshots ==

1. An example of the text on the editor window and the live result

2. The admin options page where you can set the colors with a colorpick and have a instant preview
